## 🏗️ Data Architecture & ETL Pipeline

The platform's data architecture is built for resilience and accuracy, dividing "Live" data for dashboards and "Static" snapshot data for deep-dive reporting.

1.  **Data Extraction (`fetch_data.py`):** Pulls 5 years of historical OHLCV data, financial statements (Income, Balance Sheet, Cash Flow), and company metadata using the yFinance API.
2.  **Data Transformation (`clean_data.py`):** Cleans the raw data and automatically computes over 15 financial ratios (ROE, ROA, Debt-to-Equity, Current Ratio, etc.).
3.  **Database Loading (`load_to_mysql.py`):** Safely upserts processed data into a MySQL database via SQLAlchemy using chunked batch processing.
4.  **Automation (`daily_etl.yml`):** GitHub Actions triggers the pipeline daily, pushing fresh CSV data to the frontend and updating the database.
